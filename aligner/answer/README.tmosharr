> This README file constains information about the taks performed by `tmosharr` on Homework 3.
The description of the mathematical models and algorithm used can be read on file: [description_algorithm.pdf](description_algorithm.pdf)

###
Please run for 10 epochs to get best AER. the number of epochs can be controlled by: 

python answer/align.py -p europarl -f de -n 100000 -k 10 > output.a
head -1000 output.a > upload.a 

### Turash Mosharraf - tmosharr
Turash was in charge of implementing the baseline, applying smoothing and enhancing the algorithm using both P(f|e) and P(e|f)   
for the project.

#### Tasks performed

- Implementation of baseline described on [here](http://anoopsarkar.github.io/nlp-class/hw3.html).
- Implementation of mathematical models.
- Research and brainstorm on how to improve the speed of the algorithm of our group.
- Testing results against given references.
- Planning dates, preparing and submitting files.

Methods:

- Method 1. METEOR (baseline)
- Method 2. ROSE (only 1 feature vector comparing at sentence level with 13 elements (not custom)).
- Method 3. ROSE (2 feature vectors, both 13 elements comparing at sentence level. One is for scores (1-gram through 4-gram, calculating precision, recall and f1-measure) the regular sentence and the other is scores the same sentence without stopwords (not custom). It also put all characters in lower case).
- Method 4. It is same as Method 3, but we remove all chars with punctuation from the input.
- Method 5. An improvement of Method 4 by including scores for ngrams at sentence level. The first feature vector now has 14 elements.
- Method 6. An improvement of Method 5. Removes all unicode characters from the sentence and uses Wordnet to lemmatize the input.
- Method 7. An improvement of Method 6. Uses Wordnet to check similarity among words.
- Method 8. An improvement of Method 7. Uses levenshtein distance in case that wordnet did not find.

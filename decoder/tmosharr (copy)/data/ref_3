Senators will have to do their own research to find out who was at fault.
When a person accepts a job, it must accomplish it.
The women who sit on the Senate have proved.
They fulfilled their duty much better than the majority of men in the Senate.
I remember the meetings of the subcommittee on veterans in February 1998.
Neither the Senate nor the House of Commons sat at that time.

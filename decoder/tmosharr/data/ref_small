Honorable senators, what happened last Tuesday?
A Selection Committee was formed.
I attended the first meeting of this committee yesterday.
And I expected the committee to admit that he did not know what to do with the independent senators.
Which does not concern me so much for now.
The members of the Selection Committee may have some impact.
On the work that a senator will undertake over the next two years.

On the work that a senator will undertake over the next two years.
It is an important committee, since in principle these nine senators determine which committee will sit on certain senators.
I went to committee yesterday to find out that one of the nine senators was absent.
He had sent a replacement.
Honorable senators, I will not name anyone.
You see how nice I am, is not it?

## Decoding - Homework 4 - CMPT 825 & CMPT 413
> This README file constains information about the taks performed by `jylew` on Homework 4.
The description of the mathematical models and algorithm used can be read on file: [description_algorithm.pdf](description_algorithm.pdf)

### Instructions on how to run:
The algorithm is described on _page 36_ of __Sarkar 2011__ and is taking around 4 hours to run. For this reason, we suggest you using our `model` file direclty. Please follow the instructions below and unzip it inside this directory.


### Justin Lew - jylew
- Pair programmed with sjjung, trying to implement the baseline
- Attemped to improve the model implemented by lperesde and tmosharr with given reference
- Writing documentation for the project
- Documented the implemented pesudocode using LaTeX
